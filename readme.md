# OPM Consultant Database

## Instructions
Clone the repo, set up a virtual environment and install requirements, then from a command line in the project root folder do: ```python manage.py migrate``` to create the database (not committed to repo so yours will be empty). Finally do ```python manage.py runserver``` to start a development server.
